                            Technology and the internet should be there to enhance and simplify our lives rather than be a cause of distraction, worry or upset.
                            However, not all online experiences are positive for young people, and this can have a negative impact on how they feel about themselves, their friendships and relationships and even how they see the wider world.

It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information. An online identity may even be determined by a user’s relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity.</div>

                            As the internet grows over the years and becomes prevalent around the world, Social Media has become a part of people’s daily lives.
                            
                            There are a bunch of positive benefits social media has brought us, such as providing easy and instant communication with family, friends, and colleagues, regardless of long distances. Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram offer entertainment and creative outlets for users to share their talents and hobbies. Social media also amplifies voices and mobilizes support for social causes, driving change and raising awareness about important issues.

Excessive use of social media can lead to addiction, reducing productivity and negatively impacting daily activities. Cyberbullying and harassment also exists in social media unfortunately.

                            Fear of Missing Out. FOMO has become a common theme, and often leads to continual checking of social media sites. The idea that you might miss out on something if you’re not online can affect your mental health.
                            
                            People who spend the most time interacting and posting in social media are likely to compare themselves to others on social media which can lead to negative self-perception and feelings of inadequacy.
